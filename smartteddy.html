    <div class="intro">
        <p>Smart Teddy is a product that was designed for college students that miss a pet back at home, 
            giving them an opportunity to still interact with them to receive the same satisfaction that 
            they receive interacting with them physically.</p>
        <p>Project was broken into multiple parts, echoing the importance of each step in the design process.</p>
        <p>Group Count: 4 (including myself)</p>

        <h2><em>Step 1:</em> Identifying project topic and user group</h2>
        <p id="center">Brainstorming various problems and solutions. The group had to come to a consensus for the topic.</p>

        <div class="group1">
            <h3>Problem Space</h3>
            <p>College is an extremely stressful time, but most students don’t have 
                pets during college. Despite it being helpful, it’s difficult for Cornell students 
                to seek animal companionship when they’re stressed or sad.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="group2">
            <h3>User Group</h3>
            <p>Stressed out students who miss their pets at home.</p>

        <h2><em>Step 2:</em> Interview plan and protocol</h2>
        <p id="center">Conducting eight 30-minute contextual interviews focusing on participants within the specified user group. </p>
        <p id="side1"><em>Interview Goal:</em> To gather information about the students’ general experiences with pets, both with their own, and with pets 
            they may or may not have been able to interact with on a college campus.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="step">
        <h2><em>Step 3:</em> Data Analysis</h2>
        <p id="center">Based on the data collected from the interviews, we created an affinity diagram to group the information 
            collected into synthesized themes and insights. We then used these insights to analyze an in-depth understanding of any 
            common behaviors, challenges and attitudes throughout the user group.</p>

        <p id="side2">Screenshots of the afinity diagram on a Miro Board:</p>

                <h3>Some insights and observations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Insight 1:</em> Users tend to look at pictures of their pet or talk about their pet with family and friends when they miss their pet.</li>
                    <li><em>Insight 2:</em> Users tend to feel a personal connection to their specific pet that cannot be replaced.</li>
                    <li><em>Insight 3:</em> Users tend to have busy schedules with school work that hinders their ability to have a pet at school, especially due to the 
                    attention demanded by pets such as dogs.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="persona">
                <p>We also developed a persona based on the user data and requirements that our product will need to fufill to meet these user needs. This is all shown here:</p>

    <section class="step">
        <h2><em>Step 4:</em> Brainstorming</h2>
        <p id="center">As a group, we considered multiple product ideas and discuessed which product would be unique, creative and sufficient for our users. </p>
        
        <p id="side2">We sketched out the idea of our product:</p>

        <img src="images/teddy.jpg" alt="teddy">
        <img src="images/dispenser.jpg" alt="dispenser">
        </div>

        <p id="side3"><em>Our Design:</em> A customizable stuffed animal that comes with a treat dispenser to set up back at home. 
            The stuffed animal allows you to see and interact with your pet live through it’s built in LCD touch screen. 
            Giving treats to your pet on command, taking snapshots, and updating your family on the dispenser status all make a memorable 
            experience for you and your loved one!</p>

        <div class="goals">
        <p>We then connected our user goals to a specific task that can be found in the design. We stated the task, a scenerio, and a story board 
            showing how the user will complete the task using the product. </p>

            <h2><em>Step 5:</em> Prototyping</h2>

            <p id="center">Created a mid to high-fidelity prototype after receiveing feedbacks of mutiple prototypes from each member of the group. 
                This prototype would represent the application on the stuffed animals screen since there is no app connected with this product.</p>
