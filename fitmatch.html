<div class="section bg">
    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>

    <p>
        With the rise of e-commerce and limited in-person shopping options for college students, 
        young women often face overwhelming uncertainty when buying clothes online. Promotional images 
        are overly stylized, size charts inconsistent, and user reviews vague or unhelpful, leaving shoppers 
        unsure about fit, style, and quality. As part of a 4-member team, I contributed as a UX researcher 
        and designer to create FitMatch: a community-driven platform that helps users make confident 
        clothing purchases. By leveraging peer validation, realistic fit visuals, and personalized recommendations, 
        FitMatch empowers young women to shop online with greater trust and satisfaction.

    <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
    <p><em>
        Young female college students face uncertainty and information overload when making 
        online clothing purchases, hindering confident decisions.
    </em></p>

    <p>
        Young women represent a significant share of the online fashion market. 53.4% of all online shoppers are 
        women, and those aged 18 to 24 account for 46.9% of this group. Yet, they face persistent challenges when 
        shopping online. Inconsistent size charts, overly stylized product photos, and vague user reviews make 
        it difficult to gauge how clothing will fit or look in real life. This lack of trustworthy, detailed 
        feedback often leads to hesitation, dissatisfaction, and costly returns. As online platforms prioritize 
        promotional content over shopper-centered information, there is a pressing need for tools that empower 
        users to make confident, informed decisions.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section goals-fm">
    <h3>GOALS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To understand the emotional, social, and cognitive factors shaping online fashion shopping among young women</li>
        <li>To explore user-generated content as a source of trust and empowerment</li>
        <li>To co-create design directions aligning with users' needs, shopping behaviors, and information-filtering strategies</li>

<div class="section methods-fm">
    <h3>METHODS</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Rapid Ethnography + Contextual Interviews</li>
    <li>Co-Design Workshops</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section reasoning">
    <h3>REASONING</h3>
    <p>The rapid ethnography combined with contextual interviews allowed us to “be there” and observe participants in their natural environments as they 
       navigated online shopping platforms. By pairing observations with contextual interviews, we could 
       bridge the gap between what users say they do and their actual behaviors, capturing both habits and 
       emotional drivers. I was responsible for conducting 1 out of the 4 interviews. The co-design 
       gave us a way to surface tacit knowledge through sketching, scenario-based tasks, and interactive 
       design activities. This participatory approach allowed users to become collaborators in generating 
       solutions, ensuring our designs reflected their lived experiences. I was responsible for conducting 
       1 out of the 2 workshops with my partner.</p>

                <p>I took the initiative of coming up with a reward system where the profile page tracks rewards earned from posting reviews and photos, 
                    showing users how their contributions benefit them (e.g., discounts). It also allows easy updates to body measurements, keeping 
                    avatar visualizations accurate over time. This gamified approach motivates users to stay active and continue enriching the community</p>

<div class="section difference">
<h2>What makes FitMatch Different?</h2>
    <p>Although emerging technologies like virtual try-ons and recommendation systems address fit uncertainty,
        most solutions are designed from a top-down, tech-driven perspective. They often overlook the emotional and social dimensions of online shopping, such as the 
        need for peer validation, representation of diverse body types, and community-driven trust building. FitMatch reimagines the online shopping experience 
        by centering the voices of users themselves. Through participatory design methods like co-design workshops and ethnographic research, we developed a platform that emphasizes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Authenticity: Real-world fit photos and reviews from people with similar body types</li>
        <li>Community: A supportive space where users share their experiences and earn rewards</li>
        <li>Inclusivity: Personalized visualization tools that celebrate diverse body shapes and reduce body image insecurities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By focusing on both practical and emotional needs, FitMatch empowers users to shop confidently and feel represented in a space that prioritizes their 
        lived experiences.</p>
</div>

<div class="section limitations">
    <h3>LIMITATIONS AND REFELCTION</h3>
    <p>While our design emphasized real-world visuals and body-matching, it couldn’t fully replicate the tactile experience of trying on clothing, like feeling fabric 
        texture or stretch. We also recognized that the platform’s success depends on sustained user participation and the accuracy of self-reported measurements, which 
        could vary across users. In future iterations, exploring ways to integrate physical-digital touchpoints, such as partnerships with retailers for in-store scanning or 
        fabric sampling, could help bridge this gap. Additionally, building stronger incentives and community engagement strategies would support more consistent contributions 
        from a diverse user base.</p>
