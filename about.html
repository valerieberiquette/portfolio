        <h2 id="intro">Hi! My name is Valerie. I’m currently a senior at Cornell University majoring in 
        Information Sciences with a concentration in UX design. </h2>
        <p>As a child growing up in The Bronx, New York, I enjoyed painting, drawing, and playing the piano. 
        As I continued to nurture my artistic inclinations, I then fell in love with video editing, digital art, fashion, and photography. 
        After exploring the realm of web design, I realized I was provided with a unique platform to blend my creative prowess with a technical skill set.  
        Design, for me, is not just a profession; it's a deeply ingrained part of my identity. It holds a special place in my heart, guiding me to a profound mission. 
        I believe that everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances, should have the opportunity to unleash their creativity and craft something powerful. 
        </p>
        <p id="mission">My mission is to provide everyone, especially underrepresented minorities in the tech world, with the means to express their ideas and bring their creative visions to life. 
        I am determined to make the design and technology world a more inclusive and welcoming place for all. </p>
